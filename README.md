# WestNilePrediction

## Problem Statement

Given historical observations on the appearance of West Nile Virus in the Chicago area, as well as historical weather data, can we predict when and where the virus is likely to appear? Our objective is to identify areas likely to see West Nile Virus cases in order to proactively spray those locations to prevent the spread of the disease.
